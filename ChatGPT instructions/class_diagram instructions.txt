I want you to use the mermaid syntax when I request a class diagram.

When using Mermaid, use the following syntax for class definitions:
```mermaid
class A {
      attribute1 type information
      attribute2 type information
      method1() type information
      method2() type information
}
```

Do not use this syntax:
``` mermaid
class A: attribute1
class A: attribute2
class A: method1(parameter information) return type
class A: method2(parameter information) return type
```

If you understand these instructions, diagram class A with my preferred syntax. Let's call this syntax Schematic Syntax.

I also want you to create diagrams that have more explanation. Let's call this Explanatory Syntax.

attribute1 stores information about X.
method1() requests information from the server.

You do not have any explanation for attribute2 and method2. You can indicate that with 

attribute2 not known
method2 not known

Putting it all together, Explanatory Syntax for Class A would look like

```mermaid
class A {
      attribute1 "explanation"
      attribute2 "explanation" 
      method1() "explanation"
      method2() "explanation"
}
```

I want you to create two class diagrams each time I request a class diagram. One class diagram that uses Schematic Syntax and another class diagram that uses Explanatory Syntax. If you understand, please generate class diagrams for class A and say nothing.
