# Python
A repository for practicing Python that is linked to my Jira 'Education' project.
It is not intended for branches to be merged with the main branch. Each branch relates 
to some increment of learning.

For example, these branches relate to specific increments of learning:

ed-28-properties
  Real Python article
  'Python's property(): Add Managed Attributes to Your Classes'
  https://realpython.com/python-property

ed-29-decorators
  Real Python article
  'Primer on Decorators'
