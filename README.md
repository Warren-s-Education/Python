# Python
A repository for practicing Python that is linked to my Jira 'Education' project.
Each branch relates to some increment of learning, and it is not intended for branches
to be merged with the main branch. 

For example, these branches relate to specific increments of learning and will remain 
unmerged, even when completed.
